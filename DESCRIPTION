Version: 0.0.0.9000

Description: PCR tasks - like plate layout planning, dilution calculations, visualization, and analysis - are often repetitive, tedious, prone to error, and poorly documented. amplify seeks to automate these tasks, as well as documenting them (through both code and generated reports) as a bonus.
