**amplify** automates routine pcr-based tasks - including plate planning, dilution making, visualizing, and analyzing - so rather than thinking about your experiments themselves, you can think about what your experiments *mean*.

## Installation

You can install this package from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("KaiAragaki/amplify")
```
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(amplify)
library(readxl)
library(knitr)
library(dplyr)
```


## Tidying qPCR data

Data exported from QuantStudio is fairly non-standard:

```{r untidy_pcr}
untidy_file_path <- system.file("extdata", "untidy-pcr-example.xls", package = "amplify")

untidy_file_path |> 
  read_excel() |>
  select(1:10) |> 
  head()
```

amplify provides `pcr_tidy` to automatically tidy these files:

```{r tidy_pcr}
tidy_pcr <- untidy_file_path |> 
  pcr_tidy()

tidy_pcr |>
  select(1:10) |> 
  head()
```

`pcr_tidy` works with both ddCt or standard curve result files.

## Plotting qPCR results

Tidied results can be plotted using `pcr_plot`

```{r pcr_plot}
tidy_pcr |> 
  pcr_plot()
```

Additionally, overviews of plate features can be done using `pcr_plate`

```{r}
tidy_pcr |> 
  pcr_plate_view("target_name")
```

More details can be found in the **Analyzing ddCt qPCR with amplify** vignette.

## Library Preparation Quantification

### Library Preparation Quantification Calculation

RNA library preparation results output from Quantstudio can be tidied using `pcr_tidy`:

```{r}
untidy_lib_path <- system.file("extdata", "untidy-standard-curve.xlsx", package = "amplify")
tidy_lib <- pcr_tidy(untidy_lib_path, pad_zero = TRUE) 
tidy_lib |>
  select(1:10) |> 
  head()
```

Calculating the concentration of library (before dilution) can be performed using `pcr_lib_calc`:

```{r}
calc_lib <- pcr_lib_calc(tidy_lib) 

calc_lib |> 
  select(task, sample_name, concentration) |> 
  head()
```
### Library preparation quantification quality control

We can generate useful plots to determine the quality of the quantification run by first using `pcr_lib_qc`:

```{r}
qc <- calc_lib |> 
  pcr_lib_qc()
qc
```
These data, by themselves, are not particularly useful. However, a suite of QC plotting functions can be used upon these data to give insight, such as:

```{r}
qc |> pcr_lib_qc_plot_conc()
```

All QC plotting functions can be run and generate a report using `pcr_lib_qc_report`.


```{r eval = FALSE}
qc |> pcr_lib_qc_report("path/to/my/report.html")
```

More information about the plots available, as well as their interpretations, can be found in **Performing Library Quantification QC**
